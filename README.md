# futball.io Backend

This is the backend server for **futball.io**, a football data viewer app. It acts as a secure proxy between the frontend and the [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/) service, hiding the API key and handling request forwarding.

The frontend of this project is available at [here](https://github.com/ArfanAnulal/futball.io-frontend).
